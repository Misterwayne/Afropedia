- **Fix:** Added rate limiting with slowapi (5/min for auth, 30/min for search)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 4. **Insufficient Security Headers - MEDIUM** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue:** Missing critical security headers
- **Risk:** Clickjacking, MIME sniffing, XSS
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive security headers
- **Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üîß Security Improvements Implemented

### Backend Security
- ‚úÖ **CORS Configuration:** Restricted to specific domains

- ‚úÖ **Security Headers:** Comprehensive header implementation
- ‚úÖ **Password Validation:** Strong password requirements
- ‚úÖ **File Upload Security:** Type and size validation
- ‚úÖ **JWT Configuration:** Secure token handling

### Frontend Security
- ‚úÖ **XSS Protection:** HTML sanitization for user content
- ‚úÖ **Security Headers:** CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
- ‚úÖ **Content Security Policy:** Restrictive CSP rules
- ‚úÖ **Safe HTML Rendering:** Sanitized search highlights

## üîç Remaining Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement CSRF Protection** - Add CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
2. **Add Request Logging** - Log all API requests for monitoring
3. **Implement Account Lockout** - Lock accounts after failed login attempts
4. **Add Input Length Limits** - Prevent buffer overflow attacks

### Medium Priority
1. **Add API Versioning** - Implement API versioning for security updates
2. **Implement Request Signing** - Add request signature verification
3. **Add Database Encryption** - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
4. **Implement Audit Logging** - Log all administrative actions

### Low Priority
1. **Add Honeypot Fields** - Detect automated attacks
2. **Implement CAPTCHA** - Add CAPTCHA for sensitive operations
3. **Add IP Whitelisting** - Restrict admin access to specific IPs
4. **Implement Session Management** - Add session timeout and renewal

## üöÄ Deployment Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] CORS configured for production domains
- [x] Security headers implemented
- [x] Rate limiting enabled
- [x] XSS protection active
- [x] File upload validation working
- [x] Password requirements enforced

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts
- [ ] Check rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Verify security headers in browser
- [ ] Test file upload restrictions
- [ ] Monitor API usage patterns
- [ ] Regular security scans

## üîê Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Failed Login Attempts** - Should be < 5% of total attempts
2. **Rate Limit Hits** - Monitor for abuse patterns
3. **File Upload Rejections** - Check for malicious uploads
4. **API Response Times** - Detect DoS attempts
5. **Error Rates** - Monitor for attack patterns

### Alert Thresholds
- **Failed Logins:** > 10 per minute from same IP
- **Rate Limit Hits:** > 50 per hour from same IP
- **File Upload Rejections:** > 20 per hour
- **API Errors:** > 5% error rate

## üìã Security Maintenance
